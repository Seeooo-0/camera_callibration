# camera_callibration
* camera callibration &amp; Pose Estimation *
* This third project contains code examples briefly written in Python with OpenCV.*

- ðŸ’¡ Using python & OpenCV
- ðŸŽ¡ It is a code implemented through **ChatGPT** referring to the class time code.  
- The video I filmed is as follows.

- Camera matrix, Distortion coefficient

```
## Camera Calibration Results
* The number of selected images = 2
* RMS error = 1.6653035177858788
* Camera matrix (K) = 
* [[2.94749334e+03, 0.00000000e+00, 6.10563947e+02],
  [0, 2.94478350e+03, 3.25682941e+02],
  [00.00000000e+00, 0.00000000e+00, 1.00000000e+00]]
* Distortion coefficient (k1, k2, p1, p2, k3, ...) = [-1.18716673e+00,  5.11612278e+01,  8.58489735e-03,  1.19015586e-03, -8.64504808e+02]
